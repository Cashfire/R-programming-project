##Data
The zip file containing the data can be downloaded: specdata.zip. (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/rprog%2Fdata%2Fspecdata.zip)
The zip file contains 332 comma-separated-value (CSV) files containing pollution monitoring data 
for fine particulate matter (PM) air pollution at 332 locations in the United States. 
Each file contains data from a single monitor and the ID number for each monitor is contained in the file name. 
For example, data for monitor 200 is contained in the file “200.csv”. Each file contains three variables. 
Date: the date of the observation in (year-month-day) format, 
sulfate: the level of sulfate PM in the air on that date (measured in micrograms per cubic meter), 
and nitrate: the level of nitrate PM in the air on that date (measured in micrograms per cubic meter)
